* Test  close()
* Clean up the phidget_on_attach
  * also provide a stub for the detach functionality

* We should define a Phidgets::LIBRARY_VERSION

* Upgrade the initializer
  * Upgrade the constructor
    * Compass correction setting in constructor
    * You should pass the sample rate here as well, and set it in the attach
  * Get rid of the _x _y and _z - use an array
  * We need to return the axial limits for all dimensions
  * Probably a zero_gyro function too

* We should raise errors and reference the error constants

* Should we null out the measurements on detach?
  * Probably we should at least null out the sample rate controls
  * Maybe just make it all polled values

* Then implement the gps in C


* Perhaps we should do this for the 'production' mode, and switch to apache:

  * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example

* Back to maps:
  * This is what we should do on the maps:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
  and cache!

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml
  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection
