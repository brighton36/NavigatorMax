* Prune the libs we don't use out of the system sensor

* I think we need a System, and an Analog Sensors tab
  * And do a time plot for the indicators

* Migrate over to that data_table helper in your views

* I think the way to fix the gmaps redraw bug is to call during a tab switch
  google.maps.event.trigger(map, 'resize');
  or this: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3360494/keep-a-google-maps-v3-map-hidden-show-when-needed

* The commrate code is off for the case of a multi-second interval between samples. (It should be fractional in this case)

* We should override the on_error and on_detach handlers like we did the attach handlers
  * and then junk the crazy int-based code

* Rename VECTOR_COLORS to say COLORS

* GPS TODO:
  * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml

* Then work on the compass output
  * TODO: This should be relative to the ground. Maybe...
  * Look through the compass.m implementation, and see what you think....

* GUI : On commloss should retry connection

* Under a general tab
  * Maybe a system load memory consumption gc stats, etc
