* Then implement the gps in C
  * Then work through sample! 
    * I think this needs to be done with the system tools, as we don't always have time available..
  * Address the TODOs in the gps.c and test
  * Make sure we label the units correctly in the rdoc
  * Time functions should be labeled in UTC
  * We may need to shy away from the ensures in our threaded handlers. 
    * Alternatively, we can just allow the unknownvals to slide...

* Then implement the interfacekit in C
* Then implement the servocontroller in C

* Decide if we should do something about phidget_on_error either raise an error or do nothing...
  * I'm thinking nothing...

* Sometimes the Phidget.all function segfaults while enumerationg. I think a sleep will work

* Perhaps we should do this for the 'production' mode, and switch to apache:

  * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example

* Back to maps:
  * This is what we should do on the maps:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
  and cache!

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml
  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection
