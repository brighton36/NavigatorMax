* Finish the system tab
  * Something is up with stacking...
    * Get the vector colors showing in the table and matching the graph
  * Prune the libs we don't use out of the system sensor
  # In KiB
  @process_rss = `ps -o rss= -p #{Process.pid}`.chomp.to_i

  # 
  @process_cpu_usage,@process_threads = `top -l 1 -pid #{Process.pid} -stats cpu,threads`.lines.to_a.last.split ' '

* Migrate over to that data_table helper in your views

* The commrate code is off for the case of a multi-second interval between samples. (It should be fractional in this case)

* Rename VECTOR_COLORS to say COLORS

* Back to maps:
  * This is what we should do on the maps:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
  and cache!

* We should override the on_error and on_detach handlers like we did the attach handlers
  * Possibly - let's get the pi working first. We may want to dump the handlers for all but 
  * and then junk the crazy int-based code

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml

  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection
