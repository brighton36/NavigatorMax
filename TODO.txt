* I think we're going to need gc...
  * Seems like we have it mostly working. Clean it up?
    * Add error handling
  * I think the problem is that the proc used by the the phidget lib isn't a constant
  * Try the GC.disable/enable and stress = on

* Get the gyro display working

* Then work on the compass output
  * TODO: This should be relative to the ground. Maybe...
  * Look through the compass.m implementation, and see what you think....

* Samples/sec would be nice to show. Maybe move that and a draws/sec to the left col

* GPS TODO:
  * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml

* Under a general tab
  * Maybe a system load memory consumption gc stats, etc
