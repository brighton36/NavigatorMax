* I think we need an id for each mission
  * So - we need to remove the null assignment from the on_form_delete, this should go into the models collection (where null is assigned to the element)
  * Actually, we may need null assignment in both places
* Then the field validations
  * What happens if they type a duplicate title for a mission, and before they leave the input, they select a different mission?
  * Unpersisted missions should be starred in the select label. ALso, no crazy chars in the title
* When we run an on_select, we need to check the validity of each input to ensure it's valid. It's possible they selected an unpersisted record with invalid attributes
* The persisted value shouldn't be set to 'New Misson' when a created mission has its title changed
* Then the waypoints!

Deployment test prereqs:
  * Get the joystick working for accel and rudder
  * Get the system cpu temp working
  * Maybe get a config file too?

* Replace the Orientation screen with a Mission view
  * Figure out dirty and validate

* Sketch out a home screen that incorporates throttle and servo state
  * We might want to display SNR somewhere
  * signal and battery on the home page would be nice/needed...
  * 3d view with a model? maybe just rotate it via a constant for now

* True north vs mag north?
  * We should depict this somewhere, and it should be a feature of the artoo orientation, not the phidget lib

-- Test run! Checklist:
  * Compass Calibrate
  * Check for spinning Gyro
  * Wait a minute for the filter to stabilize orientation
  * Battery checks
  * Temp checks

* Perhaps we should do this for the 'production' mode, and switch to apache:

---------------------------------------
* Maybe?: Sometimes we get a JSON::GeneratorError: 882: NaN not allowed in JSON
* It'd be nice to add a spec to test for segfaults when the devices aren't connected...

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml
  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection
