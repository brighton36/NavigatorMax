* Clean up the js and the rails code a bit
  * We need a better dispatch model for handling the animate() and ws.event loops
    * Use: Object.keys($.bbq.getState())[0]
    * Most of our gadgets need to be objects, and when called upon, drawn
    * Figure out how that animate loop runs

* Then work on the compass output
  * TODO: This should be relative to the ground. Maybe...
  * Look through the compass.m implementation, and see what you think....

* GUI : On commloss should retry connection
  * We should indicate comm status in upper right, along with FPS

* GPS TODO:
  * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml

* Under a general tab
  * Maybe a system load memory consumption gc stats, etc
