* We may need common stuff in a common.c
* We shouldn't Prefix the Errors with Phidget

* We should probably not register the handlers until open() is called

* Then implement the gps in C

* Decide if we should do something about phidget_on_error either raise an error or do nothing...
  * I'm thinking nothing...

* Perhaps we should do this for the 'production' mode, and switch to apache:

  * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example

* Back to maps:
  * This is what we should do on the maps:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
  and cache!

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml
  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection
