* Upgrade the spatial
  * Move sampling into a helper somewhere
  * Yeah - and I don't like those constructor parametrs after all - make those functions


* Handle errors:
  * We should likely have better errors raised on crappy inputs (constructors mostly)
    * Use CPhidget_getErrorDescription
  * We should raise errors in the on_error code and translate the error constants

* We should define a Phidgets::LIBRARY_VERSION
* We should provide a list or find_all method

* Then implement the gps in C
  * If there's no handle by the time it gets to device::init, we should use a generic handle. Test this before/during the gps implement

* Perhaps we should do this for the 'production' mode, and switch to apache:

* Back to maps:
  * This is what we should do on the maps:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
  and cache!

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml
  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection
