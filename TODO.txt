* Alright - implement the rest of on_data
  * gyro needs time corrections 

* Compass correction setting

* Test what happens when you unplug and plug the device in
  * Do we lose our attributes?
  * Also Test the magnetic poll for the case of unknown

* Now start deploying the c-based phidget poll
  * We should override the on_error and on_detach handlers like we did the attach handlers
    * Possibly - let's get the pi working first. We may want to dump the handlers for all but 
    * and then junk the crazy int-based code

* Perhaps we should do this for the 'production' mode, and switch to apache:

  * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example

* I think? The commrate code is off for the case of a multi-second interval between samples. (It should be fractional in this case)

* Back to maps:
  * This is what we should do on the maps:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
  and cache!

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml

  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection
