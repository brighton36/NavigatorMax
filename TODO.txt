* Probably remove the dispaly attributes method and wait helper
  * See if you broke anyithing?
  * Maybe implement  a wait_for method for use in the test script

* Compass correction setting in constructor
  * You might want to pass the sample rate here as well

* Now start deploying the c-based phidget poll in orientation

* Test what happens when you unplug and plug the device in
  * Do we lose our attributes?
  * Also Test the magnetic poll for the case of unknown

* Perhaps we should do this for the 'production' mode, and switch to apache:

  * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example

* I think? The commrate code is off for the case of a multi-second interval between samples. (It should be fractional in this case)

* Back to maps:
  * This is what we should do on the maps:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
  and cache!

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml

  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection
