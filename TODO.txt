    * Might want to break out memory into separate rows
  * PID might be nice as well

* Migrate over to that data_table helper in your views

* Rename VECTOR_COLORS to say COLORS

* Now start deploying the c-based phidget poll

* I think? The commrate code is off for the case of a multi-second interval between samples. (It should be fractional in this case)

    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
  and cache!

* We should override the on_error and on_detach handlers like we did the attach handlers
  * Possibly - let's get the pi working first. We may want to dump the handlers for all but 
  * and then junk the crazy int-based code

  * GPS TODO:
