* Rename VECTOR_COLORS to say COLORS

* Then start renaming/refactoring the backend. 
  * We need to fix this on startup bug: ERROR#<Phidgets::Error::UnknownVal: Value is Unknown (State not yet received from device, or not yet set by user).>
  * And add gps support!

* Then work on the compass output
  * TODO: This should be relative to the ground. Maybe...
  * Look through the compass.m implementation, and see what you think....

* GUI : On commloss should retry connection
  * We should indicate comm status in upper right, along with FPS

* GPS TODO:
  * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml

* Under a general tab
  * Maybe a system load memory consumption gc stats, etc
