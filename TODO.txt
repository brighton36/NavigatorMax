* Probably we should start putting in rdoc now
  * http://clalance.blogspot.com/2011/01/writing-ruby-extensions-in-c-part-2.html

* Global functions...
  * We should define a Phidgets::LIBRARY_VERSION
  * We should provide interfaces for the logging
  * We should provide a list or find_all method

* Then implement the gps in C
  * If there's no handle by the time it gets to device::init, we should use a generic handle. Test this before/during the gps implement

* Decide if we should do something about phidget_on_error either raise an error or do nothing...

* Perhaps we should do this for the 'production' mode, and switch to apache:

  * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example

* Back to maps:
  * This is what we should do on the maps:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
  and cache!

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml
  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection
