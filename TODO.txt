Mission Editor:
  * THere's a bug with nil coords in the picker
  * Now get the missions plotting?
    * We need to accomodate different locations and zooms
  * Mission distance
  * The created at time doesn't show two digits for the minute if it's a single digit minute

This weekend:
  * Sunday:
    * Test run the minnow
    * Let's incorporate our command client for artoo as a patch in the local base
    * Make the bundle Gemfile a bit more dynamic:
      gem 'artoo', :path => "/opt/artoo"                    
      gem 'phidgets_native', :path => "/opt/phidgets_native"
    * Double check the wifi commands on the minnowboard, and try to get that noise reading
      * iwlist doesn't exist
      cderose@minnow:~$ cat /proc/net/wireless

    * Why does the new battery not drain at all, and the old one drains quick? Switch them around and see if placement matters
    * Coretemp is at 49-52 deg celcius on the minnow
    * Maybe get that minnowboard serial number?

Deployment test prereqs:
  * We need a little more velcro for the new battery sensors
  * Solder/test the wifi ubec?
  * Get an artoo yaml config file too?
  * Add an alert for the battery voltages:
    * Charged:  is around 4.2/4.18 per cell
    * New: is around 3.85/3.86 per cell (50%)
    * Stop: An 80% discharged LiPo cell, will give an approximate open circuit voltage of about 3.72 to 3.74 volts 
  * True north vs mag north?
    * We should depict this somewhere, and it should be a feature of the artoo orientation, not the phidget lib
    http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/declination.shtml
  * Glue the marg? waterproof the minnow?

* Sketch out a home screen that incorporates throttle and servo state
  * We may need to add a navigation pane to deal with the nav status stuff
  * We might want to display SNR somewhere
  * signal and battery on the home page would be nice/needed...
  * 3d view with a model? maybe just rotate it via a constant for now


---------------------------------------
-- Test run! Checklist:
  * Add the ip to the eth: ifconfig wlan0 192.168.1.128 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 192.168.1.255
  * Compass Calibrate
  * Check for spinning Gyro
  * Wait a minute for the filter to stabilize orientation
  * Battery checks
  * Temp checks

* Perhaps we should do this for the 'production' mode, and switch to apache:

  * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
---------------------------------------
* Maybe?: Sometimes we get a JSON::GeneratorError: 882: NaN not allowed in JSON
* It'd be nice to add a spec to test for segfaults when the devices aren't connected...

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml
  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection
