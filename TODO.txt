* Then implement the interfacekit in C
* Then implement the servocontroller in C

* Promote the lib

* Perhaps we should do this for the 'production' mode, and switch to apache:

  * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example

* Back to maps:
  * This is what we should do on the maps:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
  and cache!

* And about that gyroscope....
  * I think that we need to compute a vector from the deltas on a tick, and rotate
    the dcm by the angles of this vector on each axis

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml
  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection

* Down the line on the phidgets gem:
  * Remove the type_info and replace with extended_attributes and polled_attributes
    basic attributes (these stay in the struct)
    extended_attributes (these are pointed to and are device specific)
    polled_attriubutes these are the running state variables

    It'd be nice if we alloc'd a struct during the poll interval, and passed that
    to a method for storage, this way we could implement our sequencing code down
    the line. However, I don't think this is practical without some fancy locking,
    as we could end up free'ing the struct before it's done in the ruby thread
  * It would then be nice to have a basic_attributes, extended_attributes, and 
    polled_attributes for each class
