Mission Editor:
  * Get the mission saving
  * Then the waypoints!
    * There should be a coordinate picker feature in here somewhere for the gps

* Sketch out a home screen that incorporates throttle and servo state
  * We might want to display SNR somewhere
  * signal and battery on the home page would be nice/needed...
  * 3d view with a model? maybe just rotate it via a constant for now

Deployment test prereqs:
  * Batteries Voltage is reading negative, seems like we effed up the polarity...
  * Maybe get a config file too?
  * Double check the wifi commands on the minnowboard, and try to get that noise reading
  * Maybe get that minnowboard serial number?

* True north vs mag north?
  * We should depict this somewhere, and it should be a feature of the artoo orientation, not the phidget lib

---------------------------------------
-- Test run! Checklist:
  * Compass Calibrate
  * Check for spinning Gyro
  * Wait a minute for the filter to stabilize orientation
  * Battery checks
  * Temp checks

* Perhaps we should do this for the 'production' mode, and switch to apache:

  * https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/staticmaps/#quick_example
---------------------------------------
* Maybe?: Sometimes we get a JSON::GeneratorError: 882: NaN not allowed in JSON
* It'd be nice to add a spec to test for segfaults when the devices aren't connected...

* After testing....
  * GPS TODO:
    * Calculate true north, not mag north. Probably we just need to shell to : http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/geomag/WMM/soft.shtml
  * GUI : On commloss should retry connection
